## Combat

### Initiative
Everyone involved in combat rolls 1d20+MV. The best score has initiative, the rest acts in descending order.

### To attack
To attack, roll 1d20 adding the attackers HD + targets AC, +1 if using a two-handed weapon. If the roll is a natural 20 or the sum is 20 or higher, it’s a successful hit.

### Damage
If someone lands a successful hit, roll D, and subtract that score from the target’s hp.
At or below 0hp characters are incapacitated.

### Ofensive Maneuvers
Maneuvers like disarming your opponent, slipping past, knocking furniture over, switching positions, pushing back and others are possible.
In order to perform them, the attacker must describe the maneuver before rolling to hit.
A natural roll of 20 means that the maneuver was executed successfully. 
On a normal successful hit, the opponent decides whether to take damage or allow the maneuver.

### Defensive Maneuvers 
Any time a character would take damage in combat, before damage is rolled, the player can opt to describe if the character desperately tries to parry with his off-hand weapon, losing grip and dropping it in the process, or sacrificing his shield to avoid receiving damage.


## Feats
On most adventures, characters need to perform feats under pressure like sneaking past monsters, hiding, moving silently, picking locks or climbing steep walls. Player's attempt those feats describing how will the character carry them out.  

Then, the player rolls 1d20 adding the character's HD+MV. If the roll is a natural 20, or the sum is 20 or higher, the feat is successful and the game master describes the consequence of such feat. 


## Saving Throws
Sometimes, characters have to face perils like falls, fire, poison and even some magical effects. Player's can request a save, describing how the character tries to avoid or ameliorate those risks.

Then, the player rolls 1d20 adding the character's HD+4. If the roll is a natural 20, or the sum is 20 or higher, it’s a successful save and the game master describes the mitigated effects of such dangers.
